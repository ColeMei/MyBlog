I’m Cole Mei, a 24-year-old originally from Beijing, China, and I have been living in Brunswick, Melbourne, for a year and a half.

I believe that life is not measured by time, but by experience. So, just like the saying goes **_‘finite life but infinite exploring’_**

> ## More About

I consider myself a **geeky** person, but I don't want to define my future as a programmer in some traditional sense.

I just keep trying what I'm fond of in any realms I’m interested in. To be specific, My expertise and interest lies in **Big Data,** **Deep Learning,** **Distributed System** and any **Fun Tools** that can enhance my efficiency and serve for my personal **work flow.**

- _Always keep an open mind, use tools you wouldn't usually use, and never give up._

> ## Spare Time

When not buried in my text editor,

- I’m a big lover of **Hiphop** and **R&B** music (Updated: I'm also a fan of **Kpop** now). J.cole and Jennie are two of my favorite artists.
- I enjoy watching **TV series and Movies**. My favorite TV series is [Shrinking](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15677150/) and my favorite movie is [Interstellar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/).

- Other tags :
  - \*Big Big Fan of **Arsenal FC\***
  - _A **Moba** expert and also a **Fps** rookie_
  - **\*Tabletop game** lover\*
  - \*Amateur in **Debate competition\***
  - \*Lyrics **translator\***
  - **\*Research Explorer** in Training\*

> ## Why Blog?

- For some personal reasons, to keep track of my exploring and thinking progress and collect anything attractive and useful, which I can easily find and refer to later.
- I firmly believe that blogs are a two way conversation, hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting, resonating.

> ## Contacting Me

> ## Something Unrelated

I don't want to **over-design** the sites, so I keep them clean and make them work.
