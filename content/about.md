I’m Cole, 23-year old. I lived in Beijing, China with a whole bunch of **digital products** and all of my memories in this old but lovely house.

I believe that life is not measured by time, but by experience. So, just like the saying goes  ***‘finite life but infinite exploring’***

> ## More About

I consider myself a **geeky** person, but I don't want to define my future as a programmer in some traditional sense. After all, my major is not CS either.

I just keep trying what I'm fond of in any realms I’m interested in. To be specific, My expertise and interest lies in **Data Visualization,** **Deep Learning,** **UI design** and any **Fun Tools** that can enhance my efficiency and serve for my personal **work flow.**

- *Always keep an open mind, use tools you wouldn't usually use, and never give up.*

> ## Spare Time

When not buried in my text editor,

- I’m a big lover of **Hiphop** (especially melody rap) and **R&B** music (Now, I'm also a fan of Kpop). J. Cole and 6lack are two of my favorite singers. So, It’s entirely natural that I've listened to [‘Pretty little fears’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSgUMPHQEWw) for more than thousands of times.
  - 「I have tried to write some **verses** and **hook**, but immediately realized that I can only be a fan.」

- I enjoy watching **TV series, Movies, animations** on streaming medias, so I subscribed to huge numbers of services like Netflix, Disney+, PrimeVideo, Peacock, HboGo etc.
  - 「For Addiction of Collection ✅ For Actual Watching ❌  ￣◇￣; 」

- Other tags :
  - Big Big Fan of **Arsenal FC**
  - A **Moba** expert and also a **Fps** rookie
  - ***Tabletop game** lover*
  - *Amateur in **Debate competition***
  - *Lyrics **translator***

> ## Why Blog?

- For some personal reasons, to keep track of my exploring and thinking progress and collect anything attractive and useful, which I can easily find and refer to later.
- I firmly believe that blogs are a two way conversation, hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting, resonating.

> ## Something Unrelated

I don't want to **over-design** the sites, so I keep them clean and make them work.
